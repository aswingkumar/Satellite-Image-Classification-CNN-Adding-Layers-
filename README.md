# Satellite-Image-Classification-CNN-Adding-Layers-
- The satellite image classification project focuses on categorizing satellite images into four distinct environmental classes: cloudy, desert, green area, and water. These categories are crucial for applications in remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and geographic information systems. The dataset consists of labeled images organized into folders corresponding to each class. This classification task is approached using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which is enhanced through the use of data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and performance. By leveraging transformations such as rotation, zooming, and flipping, the dataset is effectively expanded, allowing the CNN to learn more robust features and improve its ability to distinguish between different land cover types. This case study demonstrates the power of deep learning in analyzing satellite imagery and highlights the importance of combining architectural enhancements with data preprocessing strategie
- In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained to classify satellite images into predefined land cover categories. The model architecture was incrementally improved by adding more convolutional and pooling layers, leading to better feature extraction and higher accuracy.
